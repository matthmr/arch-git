# NOTE

This is the mh fork of arch's git package. My changes are mostly for my use-case
only.

The master branch is not where most of the action occurs, instead, look for the
relevant version you want as a tag, then see if an equivalent `mh-*` version
exists as well. For example: version 2.47.0-1 has mh-2.47.0-1 as its mh
equivalent. Thoses forks are kept in the `pkg` branch.

# Changes

## [`interactive-restore-diff.patch`](./interactive-restore-diff.patch)

1. intuitive `--patch` behaviour when calling `git restore -p`: lines prefixed
   with `-` will be deleted, and those prefixed with `+` will be added
